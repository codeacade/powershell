  ### Powershel test:

foreach($procin in get-process){

  ### (get-process).cpu is empty for some of processes
  ### to have nice looking list it is set-up as "none" first
  ### then it is changed into real CPU number if available

  $cpuid = "none"
  if($procin.cpu){$cpuid = $procin.cpu}
  write-host $procin " `t`t`t Memory use = " $cpuid

  ### 3 tab signs above to align results nicely (`t)

}
